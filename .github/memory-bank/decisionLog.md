# Decision Log

T## 2025-05-03: Health Record API Models Implementation
**Decision:** Create separate response models for API communication with proper serialization annotations
**Rationale:** Maintain clean separation between API models and domain models
**Implications:** Will need mappers to convert between API models and domain models

## 2025-05-03: Result Utility Implementation
**Decision:** Create a generic Result wrapper class for handling operation results
**Rationale:** Provide a consistent way to handle success/error results across the application
**Implications:** Improved error handling and consistent API for repository operationsdocument records architectural choices and technical decisions made throughout the development of the Hanoi Pet Adoption project.

## 2025-05-03: Post-Adoption Tracking Feature Implementation
**Decision:** Implement comprehensive post-adoption tracking and support features
**Rationale:** To provide ongoing support for adopters and ensure pet well-being after adoption
**Implications:** Additional UI components, backend integration, and device capabilities required

## 2025-05-03: Care Instructions Data Source Implementation
**Decision:** Implement CareRemoteDataSourceImpl with sample data for development and testing
**Rationale:** Enable concurrent development without waiting for backend API completion
**Implications:** Will need to update with real API calls later

## 2025-05-03: Document Handling Strategy
**Decision:** Implement local document caching and FileProvider for secure document sharing
**Rationale:** Improve user experience with offline document access and secure document sharing
**Implications:** Need to manage local storage efficiently and request proper permissions

## 2025-05-03: Health Record API Models Implementation
**Decision:** Create separate response models for API communication with proper serialization annotations
**Rationale:** Maintain clean separation between API data models and domain models
**Implications:** Will need mappers to convert between API models and domain models

## 2025-05-03: UI Components for Post-Adoption Tracking
**Decision:** Use timeline-based UI for pet updates and health tracking
**Rationale:** Provides chronological view of pet's progress and health status
**Implications:** Requires recyclerview with custom adapters and media handling

## 2025-05-03: Media Handling Approach
**Decision:** Use CameraX API for photo/video capture, ExoPlayer for playback, PdfRenderer for documents
**Rationale:** Modern APIs with better performance and feature support
**Implications:** Requires additional dependencies and permissions handling

## 2025-05-03: Memory Bank Reinitialization
**Decision:** Reinitialize Memory Bank system with mode-based workflow
**Rationale:** To enhance context preservation across development sessions with structured interaction modes
**Implications:** More efficient development process with context-aware assistance

## 2025-05-03: System Patterns Documentation
**Decision:** Create systemPatterns.md to document coding standards and architectural patterns
**Rationale:** To establish consistent practices across the project development
**Implications:** Improved code quality and maintainability

## 2025-04-08: Memory Bank Implementation
**Decision:** Implement Memory Bank system for maintaining project context
**Rationale:** To ensure consistent context across development sessions
**Implications:** Improved documentation and persistent knowledge of project decisions
